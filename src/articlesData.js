            "In 'College Acceptance', I share my personal journey as a minimally verbal individual who defied expectations and pursued higher education. Despite the common assumption that my communication challenges would hold me back, I discovered that a college experience is not only possible but life-changing. I detail the obstacles I faced, the support I received from educators and peers, and the empowerment that comes with overcoming societal barriers. My story is a testament to the fact that education is accessible to everyone, and I hope it inspires others to challenge stereotypes and pursue their dreams.",
